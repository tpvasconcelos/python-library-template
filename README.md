# Python Library Template (cookiecutter)

This is a highly opinionated template.

## Setting up a new project


I would suggest that you [search PyPi](https://pypi.org/search/) and check which library names are (not)
available. Follow the next steps only after settling on an available name.


This template was implemented using [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). You will
need the utility [installed](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html) to generate the
template on you local machine.

```shell
pip install --user --upgrade cookiecutter
```

To generate a new project directory from this template, run

```shell
cookiecutter gh:tpvasconcelos/python-library-template
```
